Installing 5S Control software - Part 1 - Simple network

Once the area you want to put under control has been determined, you will need:

IP-camera(-s)* 
PC/laptop (acts as a server part)** 
Сables, housings, mounts
Switches (a router) and power supplies





* minimal tech requirements for an IP-camera: 

supports RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) & ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) compatible

** minimal tech requirements for a PC/laptop:   
PROCESSOR:                                       Intel i3 (10th gen)
RAM:                                                       8GB
STORAGE:                                             80GB
GRAPHICS:                                           GeForce RTX3060 or equivalent with 3500 CUDA cores
OS:                                                         any (with Docker application installed)



Set up a simple network including an IP camera, a router and a laptop
Connect a laptop to your local network (a router connected to a power source)
Connect an IP camera to a power source and your local network (router)
Don’t forget to locate the IP address of your camera. This can usually be found in the manual or by using a special tool. Then open a web browser on your laptop and enter the IP address of the camera in the address bar. Enter the login credentials for the camera, which can usually be found in the manual or online. If you have not changed the default login, try using the default username and password. Once you have logged in, you should be able to access the live feed from the camera

     
Transmit a video signal for processing



Next, we'll look at installing the software. In order to deploy our solution we use Docker. All the details are HERE.

Important notice: You will be able to test the 5S Control without any external connection. You only need the Internet once to download Docker and a file with our software. You can be assured of security.

Once the installation and configuration process is complete, the video stream will be processed in real time by neural network algorithms and reports on detected defects/problems will be generated.
